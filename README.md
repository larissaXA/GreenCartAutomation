## Overview
This repository contains the automation test suite for the GreenCart web application, a sample e-commerce platform for plants and groceries. The tests cover functional (UI and API) and non-functional aspects of the application, ensuring high quality, usability, and performance.
This README is designed to provide a complete understanding of the project, explain the tools used, and guide you step-by-step on how to run both the GreenCart application and the automation tests locally.

## Project Description
GreenCart is a web application that allows users to:
* Browse, search, filter, and sort products (plants, groceries).
* Manage their cart: add, update quantities, remove items, and check total prices.
* Create and delete product listings in the "My Listings" section.

The automation project is implemented using Cypress for end-to-end UI and Postman for API testing.
